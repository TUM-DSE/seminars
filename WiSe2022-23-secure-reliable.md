## Course Details

This course introduces essential techniques to make software systems reliable and secure. The course will cover a range of topics including programming languages, computer architecture, formal methods, high-performance dynamic methods, and hardware-assisted methods. The students will be able to build on their knowledge of recent advances in software/hardware defenses for various domain systems including cloud systems, cyber-physical systems, dependable systems, fault-tolerance, and system security.

The students will read, discuss, and analyze recent papers in security and reliability. Students are expected to read papers in-depth prior to class, and take turns in preparing and delivering high-quality presentations of papers. Furthermore, the students will actively participate in the discussion to critically analyze the system, and advance the state-of-the-art. More concretely, the students will learn:
Advance scientific topics in computer systems
Scientific report preparation 
Presentation and discussion of scientific results
Peer-review of the scientific reports
