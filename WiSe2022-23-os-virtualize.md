## Course Details
This course will introduce the advanced topics in operating systems and virtualization. The students will learn about system designs and emerging trends in real-world systems, including data-centers comprising 100s of thousands of machines. Such systems are operated by Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Facebook, many of whom heavily rely on virtual machines (VMs) to manage systems and are also involved in the development of hypervisors and OSes. The topics covered in this course include VMs for serverless, networking for VMs, specialized hardware for VMs and  security properties of VMs (as opposed to containerization).

The students will read, discuss, and analyze recent papers in the top conferences of this field, particularly NSDI, ATC, EuroSys, OSDI, ASPLOS, VEE, FAST, and SOSP. Students are expected to read papers in-depth prior to class, and take turns in preparing and delivering high-quality presentations of papers. Furthermore, the students will actively participate in the discussion to critically analyze the system, and advance the state-of-the-art. More concretely, the students will learn:
- Advance scientific topics in computer systems
- Scientific report preparation 
- Presentation and discussion of scientific results
- Peer-review of the scientific reports
