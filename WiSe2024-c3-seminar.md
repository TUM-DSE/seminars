  - You must register for this course in TUM Online before the course starts
- **Student note:**
  - Compulsory enrollment after two weeks of the matching outcome; students who fail to de-register in this period will be registered, evaluated and receive a grade in their student record.

## Course Details
This course will introduce advanced topics in computer security and confidential computing in the cloud. Many modern cloud workloads deal with confidential and security-sensitive data such as medical records, voice recordings, and financial information. 
However, cloud environments impose security issues because they might be maintained by untrusted and malicious cloud providers who have privileged access.
To ensure code integrity and provide strong isolation from untrusted parties, hardware-assisted confidential computing with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) has been widely studied for decades.
Typical examples include technologies such as *Intel SGX*, *Intel TDX*, *AMD SEV*, *Arm CCA* and *Arm Trustzone*. 
The students will learn about these latest confidential computing technologies to protect such security domains in the untrusted cloud infrastructures. 
The course will cover a range of topics including:
- Cloud computing systems
- Computer system security
- Trusted Execution Environments
- Confidential computing primitives (e.g., remote attestation methods)
- Operating systems and hypervisors
- Fault-tolerant and reliable systems

The students will read, discuss, and analyze recent papers in the top conferences of this field, such as OSDI, EuroSys, ASPLOS, USENIX Security, IEEE S&P, NDSS, and ACM CCS.
Students are expected to read papers in-depth prior to class and take turns in preparing and delivering high-quality presentations of the papers. 
Furthermore, the students will actively participate in the discussion to critically analyze the systems, and propose (or even implement) advancements of the state-of-the-art. 
More concretely, the students will learn:
- Advanced scientific topics in confidential cloud systems
- Scientific report preparation 
- Presentation and discussion of scientific results
- Peer-review of the scientific reports 

## Registration
