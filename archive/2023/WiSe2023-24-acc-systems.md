# Accelerated Computing Systems (“acc-systems-seminar”) -- WiSe 2023-24

## Chair website

- The seminar is organized by the [Chair of Computer Systems](https://dse.in.tum.de/) at TU Munich.

## Course Information
- Language: English
- Type: Seminar Course (BSc and MSc)
- Module: IN0014, IN2107
- Prerequisites:
   - we do not have any compulsory prerequisites, but we prefer students to be proficient in the basic concepts of accelerators (GPU/FPGA), parallel computing (OpenMP/CUDA/OpenCL), operating systems (particularly device drivers), virtualization technology, or equivalent background. Please check with the instructor, if you think your background is insufficient. 
   - Additional preferred pre-requisites, but not compulsory courses at TUM:
      - IN2073: Cloud Computing
      - IN2125: Virtualization Techniques
      - IN2076: Advanced Computer Architecture
      - Praktikum: Systems Programming in C++
      - Praktikum: Advanced Systems Programming in C/Rust
- TUM Online: You must register for this course in TUM Online before the course starts
- Student note: Compulsory enrollment after two weeks of the matching outcome; students who fail to de-register in this period will be registered for the exam

## Course Details
This course will introduce advanced topics in hardware accelerators such as GPU, FPGA, and AI-specialized accelerators (e.g., TPU) and heterogeneous computing systems. The rise of large-scale data-intensive workloads (e.g., AI applications) has been increasing demands for using such specialized hardware in modern computer systems. The students will learn about these emerging accelerators, and system designs to integrate, virtualize and control such accelerators in real-world systems. The course will cover a range of topics including: 
- Emerging accelerators (GPUs, FPGAs, TPUs...)
- Virtualization technology for accelerators
- Hardware-software co-design
- Heterogeneous task scheduling
- Security for accelerators

The students will read, discuss, and analyze recent papers in the top conferences of this field, particularly ASPLOS, OSDI, USENIX ATC, EuroSys, ISCA, and MICRO. Students are expected to read papers in-depth prior to class and take turns in preparing and delivering high-quality presentations of papers. Furthermore, the students will actively participate in the discussion to critically analyze the system, and advance the state-of-the-art. More concretely, the students will learn:
- Advanced scientific topics in accelerated computer systems
- Scientific report preparation 
- Presentation and discussion of scientific results
- Peer-review of the scientific reports 

## Registration
