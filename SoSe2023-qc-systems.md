## Course Details

Quantum computing promises exponential speedup on certain problems that are otherwise intractable by classical computers. However, quantum computers currently are noisy and small (NISQ) and as such, cannot be practically used. Researchers develop software methods that mitigate their noise and enable the execution of large programs on small quantum computers. This course explores the design and implementation of such software methods that scale quantum computing. The course will cover a range of topics including:
- Hybrid classical-quantum computing
- Divide-and-conquer approaches for scalable QC
- Software-based noise mitigation techniques
- Quantum resource management

The students will be able to build on their knowledge of recent advances in software systems that scale quantum computing including compilers, operating systems and optimization.


## Objective (expected results of study and acquired competences):

The students will read, discuss, and analyze recent papers in quantum software systems. Students are expected to read papers in-depth prior to class, and take turns in preparing and delivering high-quality presentations of papers. Furthermore, the students will actively participate in the discussion to critically analyze the system, and advance the state-of-the-art. More concretely, the students will learn:
- Advance scientific topics in quantum computing systems
- Scientific report preparation 
- Presentation and discussion of scientific results
- Peer-review of the scientific reports 


## Teaching and learning method (transfer of skills) workload for students:

We will assign papers for discussion and research study. The students will work in a team of two students. More specifically, the course will be organized in three stages:
1. Papers presentation phase: In this phase, the students will present the research papers assigned to them. They should clearly understand and explain the context of the work, contributions, and potential future work.
2. Research phase: In the second phase, the student will work on the identified research problem statement. The research phase should clearly motivate the research problem, and also should clearly explain the research methodology to solve the problem.
3. Reports and peer-review:  As the last phase, the students are expected to submit a report summarizing the presented paper and the research proposal. Further, we will be using the state-of-the-art reviewing system (hotcrp) for peer-review of the reports. In the peer-review process, the students are expected to give feedback covering the positive and critical aspects.
	
We recommend that the students devote roughly equal amounts of time for each of these phases. It is the responsibility of the presenters to manage the discussion and cover the various questions within this time.
Finally, the fellow participants are expected to read the paper and engage the presenters in an active discussion.


## Registration

**Capacity:** We plan to have at most 24 places in the seminar.
**Deadline:** Two weeks after the matching results; Students who fail to de-register in this period will be registered for the exam.


## Assessment

The course grades will be based on student presentations (40% points), a 3-4 page project report summarizing the paper and research proposal (40% points), and class participation and peer-review (20%).
