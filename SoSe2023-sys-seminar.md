## Course Details
This course will introduce the advanced topics in modern data centers and cloud computing systems. The course focuses on the software systems aspect of the modern data center systems, which underpin the underlying computing infrastructure for almost all modern data-driven intelligent applications.

The students will learn about system designs and emerging trends in real-world data centers, comprising 100s of thousands of machines as operated by Amazon AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Facebook. The topics covered in this course include modern cloud concepts like serverless, data center networking, big-data and data-processing systems, data center storage systems, data center hardware, storage systems, security and reliability, operating systems, virtualization and container, AI software and hardware systems in data centers, etc.

The students will be able to build on their knowledge in the core courses and apply the fundamental course concepts in the recent advances in the broad field of computer systems, which mainly covers areas such as distributed systems, operating systems, or storage systems, but also interfaces to related areas like security, programming languages, networking, computer architecture, software reliability, and database systems.

The students will read, discuss, and analyze recent papers in the top conferences of this field, particularly NSDI, ATC, EuroSys, OSDI, ASPLOS, VEE, FAST, and SOSP. Students are expected to read papers in-depth prior to class, and take turns in preparing and delivering high-quality presentations of papers. Furthermore, the students will actively participate in the discussion to critically analyze the system, and advance the state-of-the-art. More concretely, the students will learn:
- Advance scientific topics in computer systems
- Scientific report preparation 
- Presentation and discussion of scientific results
- Peer-review of the scientific reports 

## Registration
