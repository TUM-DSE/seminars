  - This course is open for both bachelor's and master's students. As such we do not have any
    compulsory prerequisites, but we prefer students to be proficient in the basic concepts of
    operating systems (resource management and isolation), virtualization technology, software
    verification, or equivalent background. Please check with the instructor, if you think your
    background is insufficient.

    - Compulsory enrollment after two weeks of the matching outcome; students who fail to de-register
    in this period will be registered for the exam


## Course Details

This course will cover advanced topics in verification of system software such as operating systems,
file systems, hypervisors, secure virtual machines, and firmware. System software forms the bedrock
of our compute infrastructure. Bugs and vulnerabilities can lead to devastating consequences ranging
from crashes, data loss or corruption, security violations and more. While testing can only prove
the existence of a bug, software verification provides a rigorous, mathematical proof that the
implementation adheres to its specification. The students will learn about the different approaches
of and challenges in verifying system software. The course will cover a range of topics, including:

- Verification with interactive theorem provers
- Push-button verification
- SMT-based verification tools
- Light-weight formal methods

The students will be able to build on their knowledge of system software (operating systems,
hypervisors) and software verification / proofs and apply the course concepts to the rising field of
system software verification through a number of historical and contemporary system software
verification projects.



## Objective (expected results of study and acquired competences):

The students will read, discuss, and analyze recent papers in the top conferences of this field,
particularly ASPLOS, OSDI, USENIX ATC, EuroSys. Students are expected to read papers in-depth prior
to class and take turns in preparing and delivering high-quality presentations of papers. Furthermore,
the students will actively participate in the discussion to critically analyze the system, and advance
the state-of-the-art. More concretely, the students will learn:

 - Advanced scientific topics in system software verification.
 - Scientific report preparation
 - Presentation and discussion of scientific results
 - Peer-review of the scientific reports


## Teaching and learning method (transfer of skills) workload for students:

We will assign papers for discussion and research study. The students will work in a team of two
students and hold *one presentation* in person. More specifically, the course will be organized in
three stages:

1. **Papers presentation phase:** In this phase, the students will present the research papers assigned
to them. They should clearly understand and explain the context of the work, contributions, and
potential future work.
2. **Research phase:** In the second phase, the student will work on the identified research problem
statement. The research phase should clearly motivate the research problem, and also should clearly
explain the research methodology to solve the problem.
3. **Reports and peer-review**:  As the last phase, the students are expected to submit a report
summarizing the presented paper and the research proposal. Further, we will be using the state-of-the-art
reviewing system (hotcrp) for peer review of the reports. In the peer-review process, the students
are expected to give feedback covering the positive and critical aspects.


We recommend that the students devote roughly equal amounts of time to each of these phases. Lastly,
the fellow participants are expected to read the paper and engage the presenters in an active discussion.


## Registration

- **Capacity:** We plan to have at most 24 places in the seminar.
- **Deadline:** Two weeks after the matching period, we will formally enroll you for the course. If
  you want to drop out, please inform us before the registration deadline.


## Assessment

The course grades will be based on:
- student presentation (30% points),
- a 3-4 page project report summarizing the paper (20%) and research proposal (30% points), and
- class participation and peer review (20%).


## Slack workspace

We will use Slack for all communication. Please enroll in our Slack workspace using your official
TUM email address.
